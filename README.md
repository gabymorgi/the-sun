# The Orbits of Asterogues

**The Orbits of Asterogues** introduces two brand new characters inspired by Asterogues!

Absorb projectiles, master orbital combat, and unleash devastating meteor storms.

Includes unique interactions and full **EID** support!

## 🌌 Overview

Instead of shooting tears normally, these characters manipulate **orbital tears**

Using gravitational powers, they can absorb enemy projectiles and other hazards into orbit and return them back with deadly force.

## Characters

### ☀️ The Sun

The Sun is the embodiment of strength and stability. Unshaken by chaos, he:

- **Floats** freely over obstacles from the start.
- Is **immune to wall-fired projectiles** — allowing him to calmly gather ammunition.
- Maintains a **perfectly stable orbit**: absorbed projectiles stay with him indefinitely.
- Can **control the orbit radius** using the fire buttons.

The Sun is perfect for players who like preparation before confrontation — collect your orbiting meteors, then strike at the perfect moment.

### 🪐 Pluto

After being cast out from the solar system, Pluto has returned — small, angry, and unstoppable.

- He **cannot fly**
- Is **vulnerable** to wall-fired projectiles.
- Starts with an aura that **repels enemy projectiles**.
- His **weaker gravitational field** causes absorbed projectiles to eventually drift away if unused for too long.
- Can **launch orbitals directly at enemies** using the fire buttons.

Pluto is fragile but deadly — a precise slingshot of destruction for skilled players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward gameplay.

## ✨ Extra Features

Full **EID (External Item Descriptions)** support — see custom interactions directly in-game.
