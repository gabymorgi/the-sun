## Characters

### ‚òÄÔ∏è The Sun

The Sun is the embodiment of strength and stability. Unshaken by chaos, he:

- **Floats** freely over obstacles from the start.
- Is **immune to wall-fired projectiles** ‚Äî allowing him to calmly gather ammunition.
- Maintains a **perfectly stable orbit**: absorbed projectiles stay with him indefinitely.
- Can **control the orbit radius** using the fire buttons.

The Sun is perfect for players who like preparation before confrontation ‚Äî collect your orbiting meteors, then strike at the perfect moment.

### ü™ê Pluto

After being cast out from the solar system, Pluto has returned ‚Äî small, angry, and unstoppable.

He **cannot fly**
Is **vulnerable** to wall-fired projectiles.
Starts with an aura that **repels enemy projectiles**.
His **weaker gravitational field** causes absorbed projectiles to eventually drift away if unused for too long.
Can **launch orbitals directly at enemies** using the fire buttons.

Pluto is fragile but deadly ‚Äî a precise slingshot of destruction for skilled players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward gameplay.

## ‚ú® Extra Features

Full **EID (External Item Descriptions)** support ‚Äî see custom interactions directly in-game.
