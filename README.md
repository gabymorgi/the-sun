# The Orbits of Asterogues

The Orbits of Asterogue brings two unique characters to The Binding of Isaac: Repentance, inspired by the cosmic roguelike Asterogues.

Instead of shooting normally, these characters manipulate orbital projectiles — meteors that spawn from the edges of the room. Using gravitational powers, they can absorb these and enemy bullets, storing them in orbit and launching them back with deadly force.

## Installation

1. Download the mod files.
2. Extract or copy the contents into your Isaac mods folder:
  ```
  .../Steam/steamapps/common/The Binding of Isaac Rebirth/mods/The Orbits of Asterogues
  ```
3. Launch the game and enable "The Orbits of Asterogues" from the in-game Mods menu.

## Characters

### The Sun – The Core of Power

The Sun is the embodiment of strength and stability. Unshaken by chaos, he:

- Floats freely over obstacles from the start.

- Is immune to wall projectiles, allowing him to calmly gather ammunition.

- Can absorb enemy projectiles, but his weak gravitational field causes orbiting tears to eventually drift away if unused for too long.

- Use the fire buttons to expand or contract the orbit radius, adjusting for defense or precision.

The Sun is perfect for players who like preparation before confrontation — collect your orbiting meteors, then strike at the perfect moment.

### Pluto – The Forgotten Rebel

After being cast out from the solar system, Pluto has returned — small, angry, and unstoppable.

- His hitbox is 50% smaller, making him much harder to hit.

- His orbit is perfectly stable: absorbed projectiles stay with him indefinitely until launched.

- He cannot fly, and unlike The Sun, wall projectiles can hurt him.

- Use the fire buttons to release projectiles, firing them at enemies from his orbit.

Pluto is fragile but deadly — a precise slingshot of destruction for skilled players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward gameplay.
