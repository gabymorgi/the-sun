    <description>[b]The Orbits of Asterogues[/b] introduces two brand new characters inspired by [i]Asterogues[/i]!
Absorb projectiles, master orbital combat, and unleash devastating meteor storms.
Includes unique interactions and full [b]EID[/b] support!

[h1]🌌 Overview[/h1]
Instead of shooting tears normally, these characters manipulate [b]orbital tears[/b]
Using gravitational powers, they can absorb enemy projectiles and other hazards into orbit and return them back with deadly force.

[h1]☀️ The Sun[/h1]

The Sun is the embodiment of strength and stability. Unshaken by chaos, he:

[list]
[][b]Floats[/b] freely over obstacles from the start.
[]Is [b]immune to wall-fired projectiles[/b] — allowing him to calmly gather ammunition.
[]Maintains a [b]perfectly stable orbit[/b]: absorbed projectiles stay with him indefinitely.
[]Can [b]control the orbit radius[/b] using the fire buttons.
[/list]

The Sun is perfect for players who like preparation before confrontation — collect your orbiting meteors, then strike at the perfect moment.

[h1]🪐 Pluto[/h1]

After being cast out from the solar system, Pluto has returned — small, angry, and unstoppable.

[list]
[]He [b]Cannot fly[/b]
[]Is [b]vulnerable[b/] to wall-fired projectiles.
[]Starts with an aura that [b]repels enemy projectiles[/b].
[]His [b]weaker gravitational field[/b] causes absorbed projectiles to eventually drift away if unused for too long.
[]Can [b]launch orbitals directly at enemies[/b] using the fire buttons.
[/list]

Pluto is fragile but deadly — a precise slingshot of destruction for skilled players who enjoy high-risk, high-reward gameplay.

[h1]✨ Extra Features[/h1]

Full [b]EID (External Item Descriptions)[/b] support — see custom interactions directly in-game.
